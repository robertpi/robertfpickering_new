I live near a small pond and it's usually a good place to photograph insects. As it was a sunny day today, I thought I take a look. After circling the pond, there didn't seem to be munch insect life, till I came across a patch of large daisies which where coved in honey bees.

I got these close ups using a 18-55 mm lens at 55mm with a 20mm extension tube.
