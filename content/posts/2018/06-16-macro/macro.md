More macro photography. I experimented with setting it to the smallest aperture (F27. ) Leaving the camera to choose the speed I generally end up with too lower speed and things looked blury, so I manually set the speed too, setting it at 1/125 second. In the mid-day sunshine, setting the sensitivity to 400 ISO was enough. Things generally came out a little under or over exposed, but that was fairly easy to correct.
