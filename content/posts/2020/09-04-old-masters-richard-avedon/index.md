While flicking though ["La Photographie du 20e Si√®cle"](https://www.taschen.com/pages/fr/catalogue/photography/all/45406/facts.la_photographie_du_20e_siecle.htm) I came across this 
lovely portrait of the actor Charles Chaplin on his last day in America.

I think the result is fairly similar. The original has a very shallow depth of field, with only the forehead really in focus. I chose not to try and copy that, as 
it would be extremely difficult to get the same area in focus working with the cameras self timer function.
