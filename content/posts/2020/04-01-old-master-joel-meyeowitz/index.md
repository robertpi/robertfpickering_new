Continuing from yesterdays idea of recreating photographs from photographers that I admire.

This time I tried my hand at "Still Life, 2012" by Joel Meyeowitz (and regretted the choice of title, as it seems inappropriate for someone still alive). I don't think it works as well as yesterdays, but still found it interesting, so thought I'd share the result.
