Sometimes when you click the shutter, you're just a little too slow and the scene you wanted has changed.

Here I was trying to photograph the bees resting on the flowers, but just a moment too late, and they have taken off heading to the next flow. Sadly the plane of focus is so small at this scale, when they move from the flower, they move out of the region in focus and become blurred. Still, despite the blur, I still like these images a lot, perhaps even more than the ones where I managed to capture them feeding from the flowers.
